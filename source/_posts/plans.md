## Reading Plan:
### Field Papers (More Practical, Mostly take a glance)
1. Federated Learning
2. LLM Security
3. VLM works
4. ICLR 2024 papers

### Materials (More Theoretical)
1. Komologrov Complexity, basically about compression complexity part.
2. Tensor Programs

## Experiment Plan:
I plan to do some experiments on LLM explanability.
- Simplify some codes

## Skills Learning Plan:
- I recently gain interest in: Blender and Manim.
- Some classical CS courses such as operating system, distributed system, computer graphics (6.824, GAMES101, etc.)
- Since I have been developing Minecraft mods in Java, I get interested in Kotlin.

## Development Plan:
1. A CI/CD working flow, **ComfyUI** like, for data visualization?
Needs a template for some basic model, for basic evaluation for new base model/new methods, etc.
2. papers.cool like paper reading website/tool, e.g. using prompt from my self, more complex filter(in a time range), combining e.g. sort by stars or OpenReview ratings. Display the openreview comments.

## Gaming Plan
- Propose to write Minecraft mods which could reload the world without restarting Minecraft (Time-Machine like features)
- GTNH and Factorio Playing
